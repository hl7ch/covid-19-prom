### COVID-19 Patient Reported Outcome Measurement (PROM)

[BFH](https://www.i4mi.bfh.ch) and [MIDATA](https://www.midata.coop/en/home/) are working on a Corona Science app, that is aimed to collect the symptoms of Swiss people, with the special focus on persons not having being tested. The data will be published as Open Data through MIDATA. The React Native app will be published Open Source. This implementation guide describes the data which will be available.
